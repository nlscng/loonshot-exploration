# Friday Ideas - February 21, 2026

**Goal:** Generate 10 ideas, then narrow with AI assistance.

---

## Raw Ideas (aim for 10)

1. **Create my first agent** - Theme TBD, project scope TBD. Amplihack has ample examples for learning how to build an agent.

2. **Build an MCP server** - Create a Model Context Protocol server to extend AI capabilities.

3. **Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker** - Build an agent that generates realistic synthetic personal information for benign telemetry testing. Could tie into upcoming Haymaker/benign telemetry work.

4. **Tenant resource scrubber agent** - Generate new IDs and resource names for copied tenants while scrubbing/anonymizing the original tenant's resource names. Useful for tenant data sanitization.

5. **Daily cloud design pattern learner** - Build a tool/agent that delivers a daily dose of Azure cloud architecture patterns from learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/. Spaced repetition, quizzes, or bite-sized summaries.
