# Daily Journal - 2026-02-20

**Day of Week:** Friday
**Framework Phase:** Ideation → Narrowing → Selection (ahead of schedule!)
**Time Spent:** ~25 min

## What I Did Today

### Session 1
- Completed ideation: added ideas #7-#10 to hit 10/10
- Ran AI narrowing analysis on all 10 ideas
- Tentatively selected **#1: Create my first agent**
- Decided on theme: **Netrunner Card Tutor Agent** (combines #1 + #9)
  - Fun domain keeps motivation high
  - No work context needed
  - Clear scope: quiz on cards, track progress, adapt
- Tech stack: **TBD** — considering Semantic Kernel vs Microsoft Agent Framework
  - Both are Microsoft, need to research differences
  - Want to learn agent fundamentals that transfer to ideas #3/#4 later

## Final Ideas List (10/10)

1. Create my first agent ← **SELECTED**
2. Build an MCP server
3. Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker
4. Tenant resource scrubber agent
5. Daily cloud design pattern learner
6. Directory-based session memory for amplihack (optional, default on)
7. Authenticity evaluator for Haymaker-generated names
8. Learn IaC by reverse-engineering
9. Android Netrunner card pool learner ← **COMBINED WITH #1**
10. Hydration and movement reminder

## Selected Idea: Netrunner Card Tutor Agent

**Combines:** #1 (Create my first agent) + #9 (Netrunner card pool learner)

**What it does:**
- Quizzes me on cards in the current standard format pool
- Tracks what I know vs don't know
- Adapts difficulty based on progress

**Agent skills I'll learn (transferable to #3/#4):**
- Tool definition and calling
- Orchestration loop (decide → act → observe → repeat)
- State/memory management
- Prompt engineering for agent behavior

**Tech stack:** Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
- Chosen for learning agent deployment patterns
- Can integrate Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration if needed
- Supports C#, JavaScript, Python

## Next Session

**Monday's Phase:** Select & Frame (mostly done early!)
**Action Items:**
- Research Semantic Kernel vs Microsoft Agent Framework
- Decide on tech stack
- Write the four framing sentences:
  - Who is the user?
  - What is the idea?
  - What is the desired outcome?
  - Why does it matter?
- Ask AI to gather related research

## Notes & Learnings

- Got ahead of schedule by combining Friday narrowing with early selection
- Combining ideas (#1 + #9) keeps scope fun while learning real agent skills
- Agent fundamentals from this project will transfer to Haymaker work ideas (#3, #4)
