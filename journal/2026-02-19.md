**Day of Week:** Thursday (mid-cycle catchup)
**Framework Phase:** Ideation (Friday phase, done mid-week)
**Time Spent:** ~20 min

## What I Did Today

### Session 1 (Morning)
- Switched gh auth to nlscng account
- Continued ideation for this week's cycle
- Added 3 new ideas to the Friday ideas list (now at 5/10):
  - **#3 Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker** — Generate realistic synthetic personal info for benign telemetry testing
  - **#4 Tenant resource scrubber agent** — Generate new IDs/resource names for copied tenants while scrubbing originals
  - **#5 Daily cloud design pattern learner** — Tool for daily Azure architecture pattern learning from MS Learn
- Set up journal structure for daily session tracking

### Session 2 (Afternoon)
- Added 1 new idea (now at 6/10):
  - **#6 Directory-based session memory for amplihack** — Store/resume chat history based on starting directory instead of requiring `--resume=<id>`. Automatically picks up session from when you last worked in that directory.

## Current State

**Active Exploration:** None yet (still in ideation)
**Cycle Week:** 1 (first real cycle)
**Ideas Generated:** 10/10 ✓

**Ideas so far:**
1. Create my first agent
2. Build an MCP server
3. Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker
4. Tenant resource scrubber agent
5. Daily cloud design pattern learner
6. Directory-based session memory for amplihack — Store/resume chat history based on starting directory instead of requiring `--resume=<id>`. When ye start amplihack in a directory, it automatically picks up the session from when ye last worked there. Optional but default on.
7. Authenticity evaluator for Haymaker-generated names — An agent or scoring system that evaluates whether generated persona names and Azure resource names are realistic enough to simulate real-world patterns.
8. Learn IaC by reverse-engineering — Take a small set of existing Azure resources and export/recreate them in Terraform, Bicep, and ARM. Compare the three outputs to understand trade-offs. Scope limited to one resource group.
9. Android Netrunner card pool learner — Build a tool to help new players learn the cards in the currently legal standard format pool (not the format rules, but the cards themselves). Could be flashcards, quizzes, or a browseable reference.
10. Hydration and movement reminder — A simple tool to remind me to drink water and stand up periodically throughout the workday.

## Next Session

**Tomorrow's Phase:** Continue Ideation (need 5 more ideas), then AI narrowing
**Action Items:**
- Generate 4 more ideas to hit 10
- Use AI to narrow down the list
- If time permits, select one idea and start Monday's "Select & Frame" phase

## Notes & Learnings

- Ideas 3 & 4 are closely related to Haymaker/benign telemetry work — could potentially combine
- Struggled with ideation mid-session; used brainstorm prompts to help
- Framework allows cycling/starting mid-week — flexibility is built in
