- Continued ideation for this week's cycle
- Added 3 new ideas to the Friday ideas list (now at 5/10):
  - **#3 Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker** — Generate realistic synthetic personal info for benign telemetry testing
  - **#4 Tenant resource scrubber agent** — Generate new IDs/resource names for copied tenants while scrubbing originals
  - **#5 Daily cloud design pattern learner** — Tool for daily Azure architecture pattern learning from MS Learn
- Set up journal structure for daily session tracking

## Current State

**Active Exploration:** None yet (still in ideation)
**Cycle Week:** 1 (first real cycle)
**Ideas Generated:** 5/10

1. Create my first agent
2. Build an MCP server
3. Synthetic PII agent in Haymaker
4. Tenant resource scrubber agent

## Next Session

**Tomorrow's Phase:** Continue Ideation (need 5 more ideas), then AI narrowing
**Action Items:**
- Generate 5 more ideas to hit 10
- Use AI to narrow down the list
- If time permits, select one idea and start Monday's "Select & Frame" phase

## Notes & Learnings

- Ideas 3 & 4 are closely related to Haymaker/benign telemetry work — could potentially combine
- Struggled with ideation mid-session; used brainstorm prompts to help
- Framework allows cycling/starting mid-week — flexibility is built in
