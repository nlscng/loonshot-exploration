# Daily Journal - 2026-02-23

**Day of Week:** Monday
**Framework Phase:** Select & Frame
**Time Spent:** ~30 min

---

## What I Did Today

### Session 1
- Confirmed tech stack: **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**
- Completed the four framing sentences
- Ready to move to research phase

---

## Project Framing

### Who is the user?
Myself and other Netrunner players — specifically new players trying to learn the current meta card pool.

### What is the idea?
Build an agent that helps teach new players about the meta card pools in Android Netrunner's standard format.

### What is the desired outcome?
An agentic app with a simple frontend to interact with users, teaching them about the current meta (legal cards, key cards to know, etc.)

### Why does it matter?
**Primary:** Learning to build an agent — this is the core goal. The Netrunner theme is chosen to set clear boundaries and ensure this stays a personal side project (not work-related).

**Secondary:** Actually useful for learning the card pool!

## Tech Stack Decision

**Framework:** Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
- Supports C#, JavaScript, Python
- Can integrate Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration if needed
- Teaches agent deployment patterns

**Language:** TBD (likely Python or C#)

---

## Next Session

**Tuesday's Phase:** Identify Barriers
**Action Items:**
- List barriers or constraints making the idea hard
- For each barrier, note what would change if removed
- Research how others have addressed similar constraints
- Identify data sources for Netrunner card data (NetrunnerDB API?)

---

## Open Questions

- What data source for current legal card pool? (NetrunnerDB?)
- Simple frontend — what tech? (CLI first? Web? Teams?)
- How much AI orchestration needed vs simple retrieval?

---

## Research: MS Agents SDK vs Semantic Kernel

### What They Do

| | **MS 365 Agents SDK** | **Semantic Kernel** |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Agent "container" — handles channels, state, activities | AI "brain" — LLM orchestration, plugins, memory |
| **Focus** | Deployment & communication (Teams, Webchat, etc.) | Reasoning, tool calling, prompt chaining |
| **Analogy** | The body/messenger | The mind/decision-maker |

### How They Work Together

- **Agents SDK** handles: receiving messages, managing conversation state, routing to channels
- **Semantic Kernel** handles: deciding what to say, calling tools, reasoning about card data
- **Integration**: SK can be used inside an Agents SDK agent as the AI brain

### Learning Path Options

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| **Start with Agents SDK only** | Learn deployment first, simpler | Miss AI orchestration patterns | ❌ Not recommended |
| **Start with Semantic Kernel only** | Deep AI/agent learning | No deployment channel (CLI only) | ⚠️ OK for learning, but limited |
| **Both from start** | Full picture, real-world setup | More complexity upfront | ✅ Recommended |
| **SK first, add Agents later** | Focused learning, then expand | May need refactoring | ✅ Also good |

### My Recommendation for Learning

**Option: Start with Semantic Kernel, add Agents SDK later**

1. **Phase 1**: Build agent logic with SK (tools, prompts, memory) — run in CLI
2. **Phase 2**: Wrap with Agents SDK to deploy to Webchat or Teams

This gives ye:
- Focused learning of agent fundamentals first
- Clear separation of concerns
- Ability to test without deployment complexity
- Natural progression from simple → full-stack

## Research: Frontend Options (CLI vs Webchat)

### What is Webchat?

**Bot Framework Web Chat** is a pre-built, embeddable chat UI component:
- JavaScript/React widget ye embed in a webpage
- Handles message rendering, input, avatars, rich cards
- Connects to yer agent via DirectLine API
- Highly customizable (themes, Fluent UI support)
- Used by MS Teams, Copilot, and many enterprise bots

### Comparison

| | **CLI** | **Webchat** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Terminal-based interaction | Web-based chat widget |
| **Setup complexity** | Very low — just print/input | Medium — need web server + DirectLine |
| **Dependencies** | None (Python input/print) | Web server, Azure Bot registration, DirectLine token |
| **Learning focus** | Pure agent logic | Agent + web deployment |
| **User experience** | Developer-only | Shareable with others |
| **Rich UI (images, cards)** | No | Yes |
| **Deployment needed** | No | Yes (Azure or localhost tunnel) |

### Complexity Breakdown

**CLI (Easiest)**
```
Effort: ~1 hour to get working
Stack: Python only
Deploy: None
Test: Immediate (python main.py)
```

**Webchat (More complex)**
```
Effort: ~4-8 hours to get working
Stack: Python + Web server + Azure Bot Service + DirectLine
Deploy: Need Azure resource or ngrok tunnel
Test: Need to configure channels, tokens
```

### Recommendation for Learning

| Phase | Frontend | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Phase 1** | CLI | Focus on agent logic without deployment friction |
| **Phase 2** | Webchat | Add UI once agent works well |

**Start CLI** — ye can always add Webchat later. Don't let frontend complexity distract from learning agent fundamentals.
