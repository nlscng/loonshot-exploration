# Loonshot Framework

## Overview

**Purpose:** Help individuals consistently develop and test high-ambition or "impossible" ideas by dedicating just 20 minutes a day.

**Core Principle:** Progress is made through structured, incremental work and leveraging AI for research, ideation, and execution.

**Applicability:** Suitable for both "moonshot" (radically ambitious) and ordinary-but-hard ideas.

## Weekly Workflow

### Friday: Idea Generation

- Write down 10 ideas (focus on quantity, not quality).
- Paste the list into an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) and ask for help narrowing them down.
- No further action until Monday.

### Monday: Select & Frame

- Review the AI's feedback and select one idea to pursue.
- Write four short sentences:
  - Who is the user?
  - What is the idea?
  - What is the desired outcome?
  - Why does it matter?
- Ask the AI to gather related research (academic, open source, industry) and summarize findings.
- Ask the AI to summarize your session and next steps.

### Tuesday: Identify Barriers

- Review the summary and context.
- List barriers or constraints making the idea hard or "impossible."
- For each barrier, briefly note what would change if it were removed.
- Ask the AI to research how others have addressed similar constraints.
- Have the AI summarize progress and next steps.

### Wednesday: Decompose & Measure

- Break the idea or barriers into smaller, parallel-explorable components.
- Define how you'll measure success (e.g., SMART goals).
- Ask the AI to propose evaluation strategies.
- Have the AI summarize the session and next steps.

### Thursday: Build Agents & Tools

- Build one or more AI agents to pursue the goal (using frameworks, Copilot Studio, etc.).
- Transfer relevant context to the agents.
- If possible, have the coding agent build tools needed for the exploration.
- Ask the AI to summarize progress and next steps.

### Friday: Run Agents & Iterate

- Assign tasks to your agents, encouraging parallel approaches if possible.
- Review outputs, refine measurement strategies, and iterate.
- Kill or improve agents that aren't effective.
- Keep a journal of learnings and prepare for the next session.

## Cycling the Framework

**When to Cycle:** If an idea is found to be truly impossible, not progressing, or a better idea emerges, quitting is not bad—the process of learning is the main value. This is a signal to start the framework again with new or refined ideas.

**How to Cycle:** Use learnings, invalidated hypotheses, and tools from previous cycles as grist for generating your next list of 10 ideas. Feed these into the AI to help it understand your interests and constraints, which can improve idea generation.

**Why to Cycle:** Cycling allows you to continually nurture new ideas, leverage past learnings, and avoid letting good ideas die due to lack of time or progress. It also helps build a repository of tools and artifacts that can be reused in future explorations.

## Ongoing Practices

- **Accountability:** Block 20 minutes daily on your calendar; treat it as sacred time.
- **Documentation:** Keep a running log or journal of progress, learnings, and next steps.
- **Iteration:** Use AI to summarize each session and set up the next.
- **Validation:** If an idea fails, document why—use learnings to generate new ideas.
- **Scaling:** If an idea succeeds, validate results, share with others, and consider scaling up.

## Tips

- Use AI to help structure your workflow, generate milestones, and hold you accountable.
- Don't be afraid to pursue ordinary hard problems, not just "loonshots."
- If you need to validate user interest, consider quick surveys, colleague feedback, or social posts.
- Save all tools, scripts, and rubrics you develop—they may be useful for future projects.
